    <h3>Code4SP - about the project</h3>
    <p>The design and implementation of training programs on coding have gained momentum globally, being held in virtual and non-virtual settings, including school classrooms, informal spaces, and non-formal learning environments (labs, coding fairs, specially designed challenges, etc.). Such initiatives have been seeking to educate socially excluded groups and transform them into competent labor market players capable of reacting to the unprecedented lack of software developers in the job market, thus nurturing a new generation of technicians. The acquisition of technical skills and particularly specialized knowledge related to different programming areas has been one of the main prerequisites for both work and society. Therefore, the transfer of computer programming skills via non-formal education could be considered an efficient way to boost the communities' socio-economic level.Through the Coding for Social Promotion (Code4SP) project, the consortium is seeking to respond to the emerging demand in terms of the provision of tailor-made coding training to digitally excluded participants, including migrants, refugees, and young people from disadvantaged backgrounds (dropouts, NEET, early school leavers), through the design and implementation of a concrete operational model, able to reach a policy reform. </p>

  <h3>Goals and Outcomes</h3>
    <p> - Address traditional education institutions' incapacity, which primarily acts as policy implementers to respond to the demand for coding training provision. <br>
    - The target will be reached through the upscaling of an already existing good practice at a local level in Germany, which had as a result, top paid programming jobs for asylum seekers. <br>
    - Enhance employers' motivation and predisposition for potential employment of individuals that belong to disadvantaged pop</h>ulations, thus breaking any negative stereotypes on this issue. <br>

      SPEL means “Society for the Promotion of School Establishments". It was founded in 1990, by a group of experienced teachers, who wanted to create schools that would not only teach the students but also assist them psychologically and socially. Therefore, they created a school for VET and they strategically located it in a region of high unemployment and social problems. Its focus is the students, which traditionally demand an out-of-the-box approach to teaching; therefore, SPEL integrates various out-of-the classroom dynamics in the teaching process. Since Mathematics is a traditionally challenging topic to teach in out of classroom environment, SPEL has a high interest in implementing the results of the project. <br>
